# CS 370 Module Eight Journal

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was given some starter code and a sample environment for a treasure hunt video game. My task was to design code for a pirate NPC that navigates the game world to find the treasure before the human player. To do this, I applied concepts from neural networks, reinforcement learning, and Q-algorithms to create a deep Q-learning algorithm for my pirate agent. I have also been asked to write a design defense that demonstrates my understanding of the fundamental AI concepts involved in creating and training my intelligent agent.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

Throughout this course, I've delved into various topics such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, and Q-algorithms, all of which are fundamental to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science as a whole. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain's structure, are at the core of deep learning, a subset of machine learning that has revolutionized fields like image and speech recognition. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is a paradigm where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards. This concept has found applications in robotics, game playing, and more.

Q-algorithms, particularly Q-learning, are essential in reinforcement learning as they enable agents to learn optimal policies through trial and error. These algorithms have been used in a wide range of applications, from controlling autonomous vehicles to optimizing resource allocation in computer networks. By connecting my learning in this course to the larger field of computer science, I can see how concepts like neural networks and reinforcement learning are driving advancements in AI, shaping the future of technology and how we interact with it.

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are like the architects of the digital world. They design and build the software, algorithms, and systems that power everything from smartphones to the internet. They work on creating new technologies and improving existing ones to make them faster, more efficient, and more powerful.

Their work matters because it drives innovation and progress in our society. Computer scientists are responsible for breakthroughs in fields like artificial intelligence, healthcare, and communication. They solve complex problems and develop solutions that improve our lives and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When tackling a problem as a computer scientist, it's important to start by understanding the problem thoroughly. Break it down into smaller, more manageable parts to get a clear picture of what needs to be done. Then, consider different approaches and technologies that could be used to solve the problem. Once I have a plan, I start to implement it, code, and test my solution. Iterative development is part of the job and getting used to refining my approach based on feedback and results. It's also crucial to stay curious, explore alternative solutions, and be open to learning new things along the way.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist to both end users and my organization are crucial in ensuring the integrity, security, and fairness of my work. To end users, I have a responsibility to create software and systems that are safe, reliable, and respect their privacy. This includes ensuring that my code is free from bugs and vulnerabilities that could harm users or their data, and that I handle their personal information with care and transparency. Additionally, I should strive to make my technology accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.

To my organization, I have a responsibility to act honestly and ethically in all my work. This means accurately representing my capabilities and the capabilities of my technology, and not engaging in deceptive or fraudulent practices. I should also respect intellectual property rights and confidentiality agreements, and be mindful of the potential impact of my work on society and the environment. By upholding these ethical responsibilities, I can help build trust in my work and contribute to a more ethical and sustainable future for technology.
